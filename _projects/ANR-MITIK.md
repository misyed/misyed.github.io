In this project, we propose to deploy a (scientifically determined) number of passive sniffers to measure spatiotemporal link-level activities of wireless devices in a target area. Mitik will bring solutions for related challenges such as context-aware infrastructure deployment, trace anonymization, and merging, as well as imprecise trajectory generation/reconstruction that will allow inferring individual mobility and plausible contacts among devices.
