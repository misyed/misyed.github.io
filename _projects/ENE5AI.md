In this project, we designed and deployed a hybrid (private) 5G and Wi-Fi mesh network in the basement car parking of Sorbonne Université Jussieu campus. A real-world experiment was conducted in collaboration with the Paris Fire Brigade as part of an exercise simulating an emergency response to a fire in a basement. The goal was to evaluate the network’s resilience and its capability to transmit audio and video traffic, notifications, and updates through routers carried by firefighters during the operation.
