PyPal is an updated and Python version of WiPal, which was part of Thomas Claveirole’s Ph.D. thesis back in 2010 [1, 2]. The main idea is to synchronize the traces captured by different sniffers at the
same time and to be able to merge them by removing the duplicate frames. The process is composed of five modes: (i) identifying reference frames, (ii) extraction of unique frames, (iii) intersection of unique reference frames, (iv) synchronization and (v) merging.
