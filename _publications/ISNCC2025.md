Low Earth Orbit (LEO) constellations are transforming today's modern communication era by enabling high-speed, low-latency, and reliable broadband services at a global scale. Despite their huge potential, designing efficient mechanisms for satellite networks is challenging due to the dynamic nature of LEO satellites. In this paper, we focus on routing in LEO constellations including Inter-Satellite Links (ISLs) with several constraints like e.g. minimising the maximum link utilisation. We propose a static approach aiming to find optimal paths to transmit traffic demands in the network graph. We consider Linear Programming (LP) to formulate problems for different network constraints and show that we are able to provide solutions respecting the various constraints, including those related to quality of service (QoS).
