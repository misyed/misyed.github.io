I am a Postdoctoral Researcher and Teaching Assistant at the Complex Systems Engineering Department (DISC), ISAE-SUPAERO in Toulouse, France. I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science from Sorbonne UniversitÃ© (LIP6, Network and Performance Analysis team), where my research focused on wireless passive measurements, redundancy, and network performance analysis.

My current work explores quality of service and routing optimisation in Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite networks, while my earlier projects addressed 5G and Wi-Fi mesh networks for public safety communications, in collaboration with the Paris Fire Brigade.

Over the years, I have gained experience across both academia and industry, with interests spanning wireless networks, passive monitoring, and data-driven performance evaluation. Alongside research, I have taught courses on Internet Routing, Wireless and Mobile Computing, and Mobility and Wireless Networks, and played an active role in development of open-source tools for wireless trace synchronisation (PyPal, BLEPal).

I regularly publish in international conferences and journals, and I enjoy sharing my work through invited talks.
