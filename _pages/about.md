I am a Postdoctoral Researcher and Teaching Assistant at the Complex Systems Engineering Department (DISC), ISAE-SUPAERO in Toulouse, France. I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science from Sorbonne UniversitÃ© (LIP6, Network and Performance Analysis team), where my research focused on wireless passive measurements, redundancy, and network performance analysis.

My current work explores quality of service and routing optimisation in Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite networks, while my earlier projects addressed 5G and Wi-Fi mesh networks for public safety communications, in collaboration with the Paris Fire Brigade.

Over the years, I have gained experience across both academia and industry, with interests spanning wireless networks, passive monitoring, and data-driven performance evaluation. Alongside research, I have taught courses on Internet Routing, Wireless and Mobile Computing, and Mobility and Wireless Networks, and played an active role in development of open-source tools for wireless trace synchronisation (PyPal, BLEPal).

I regularly publish in international conferences and journals, and I enjoy sharing my work through invited talks.


## Research Interests
* Wireless networks and measurements
* Network performance analysis and optimisation
* Quality of Service in LEO satellite networks

## Beyond Resarch
I have always believed life is better with a laugh. I value humour â€” with a particular appreciation for the wit and charm of British humour.

When I am not working on research, you will often find me following cricket or football â€” especially the English Premier League. I also enjoy following tennis and Formula 1 whenever possible.

Above all, I strive to inspire and support others, offering encouragement and a reminder that even in lifeâ€™s most challenging moments, there is always hope. I hope to share a little light, helping people see that struggles are not the end, and that brighter days and new possibilities are always within reach.
